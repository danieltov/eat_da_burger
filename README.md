This full-stack web app was built to demonstrate an understanding of Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, and MySQL, using MVC archicture. This simple all will create and store instances of yummy burgers into a database and allow users to "devour" it. Devoured burgers are then inducted into the `Burga Hall o Fame`.
